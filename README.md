# Dev Board Holder

What is it?

Development board holders were conceived out of a necessity to handle <br>
multiple embedded development projects while keeping things organized <br>
and neat.  This is the latest version that has been streamlined to require <br>
as little fabrication time as possible.  It is made to be robust, aesthetically <br>
pleasing, inexpensive and practical. <br>

CAD is supplied in CREO 2 (aka ProEngineer) format, but if you like to create <br>
similar layouts in other formats let me know, I can help. <br>

Also note that some of the boards you will find placed on these holders are <br>
custom and you can just ignore them unless you feel like it would be good <br>
for you to have one, in which case I can add Eagle files to this repo. <br>

Cheers.

Here is what you need to make one:

1.  12 in X 6 in X 1/2 inch thick Acrylic block (McMaster 4615T55 $13.41, you can also go with 1/4 which is<br>
    half the price but dont look as nice.)  
2.  2.3 mm diameter drill (Need this exact diamter, smaller or larger wont work)
3.  M2.5x.45 10mm Hex Standoff (Digikey 732-10397-ND) 
4.  Either
    * Use Hand Press to press fit stanoffs into the holes. (Standoffs can be pressed into 2.3 mm holes <br>
    directly which saves lots of time.)
    * Drill with 5mm socket (If you do not have a press, you will just have to use a socket wrench<br>
    to install the standoffs.)
5.  M2.5x.45 X 5 MM Pan Head Phillips (McMaster 92005A061)
6.  M2.5x.45 X 16 MM Long Flat Head (McMaster 92010A024)
7.  Solderless breadboard (Digikey BKGS-590-ND)
8.  Solderless breadboard Strip (BKGS-090-ND, I use 3 but its up to you.)

Here is how to make it:

1. Print out a 1:1 drawing of the layout you setup in CAD (This is my RaspberryPi holder. <br>
Think carefully where you place stuff and where connectors, simcards and sd cards end up.)
2. Get the clear block and send and polish the edges (DO NOT REMOVE BLUE FILM, this will <br>
make the holder look extra nice)
3. Clean the block while keeping the blue film on.
4. Cutout the siloette of the layout and spray it with backing adhesive.
5. Mount print out on the block.
6. Use drill press to drill all the marked holes.
7. Once the holes are drilled, you can peal the blue film off the top side
8. Press fit or thread the stand offs (if threading in, make sure you dont <br>
strip the treads...)
9. Peal bottom blue film off
9. Attach feet (I buy nice clear self adheasive feet on Amazon for a few bucks.)
10. Clean off any polishing compount or dust.
11. Attach solderless board and strips. (Again, make sure not to strip the treads.)
